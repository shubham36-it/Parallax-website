# Parallax-website
Parallax scrolling is a popular web design technique that creates an illusion of depth by moving background images at a slower pace than foreground content when the user scrolls. This effect can make websites feel more engaging and immersive.
Some key characteristics of parallax scrolling websites:
Background images move at a different speed than foreground content upon scroll, creating a faux-3D effect
Subtle motion and animations are often used to add visual interest and guide the user's eye
Horizontal scrolling can also utilize parallax to highlight different sections or products
Storytelling is enhanced by the depth illusion, making the experience feel more interactive.
